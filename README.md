# Js-Game-Project

Where did this idea come from?
My dad told me that he once had the idea for there to be a firefighter game where it would simulate all of the things that a firefighter would do. While I am unable simulate ALL things I figured it would be a good idea then about 1 1/2 weeks later this project came up and I figured I would put the idea to use.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
When the player selects a key to make the character move then it will change pictures to potray a walking movement to the player.
There needs to be a name given to the character image then it needs to be appended to the div marked playable area so it cannot travel outside it.
